TODOS:
Make model of a single IEEE 802.22 network
Make channels within that network
Make signals within that network
Be able to choose the number of channels and signals, then run simulation
This simulation should then show what signals will use what channels
How to implement:
Make network class
Make channel class
Make signal class
